In the Arabic language, this word is never used for any other being or thing. No other language has a distinctive name for the Supreme Being. The names found in other languages are attributive or descriptive. اَللّهُ is always used in the singular. It is a simple substantive, not derived.

		<Definition> Some say it is a proper name applied to the Being Who exists necessarily by Himself, comprising all the attributes of perfection, the ال being inseparable from it. Some say it is from اَلِهَ, either because minds are confounded or perplexed by the greatness or majesty of God or because He is the object of recourse for protection or aid. Some are of the opinion that it is from لاَهَ يَلِيْهُ which signifies height, others think that it is from لاَهَ يَلُوْهُ which signifies brightness, yet others are of the view that it is from the Syriac لاَ هاَ. But all these are mere speculations. The word اَللّهُ is derived from no other word, nor any other word is derived from it.
