<p><img src="corpus.png" alt="QuranCorpus.com"/><b> Grammar, Morphology, etc.</b></p>
    <p>The grammatical information, including root hierarchy, is developed off the resources made available by Quranic Arabic Corpus, an international collaborative linguistic project initiated at the University of Leeds, that aims to bridge the gap between the traditional Arabic grammar and techniques from modern computational linguistics. This open source resource includes part-of-speech tagging for the Quran, morphological segmentation and a formal representation of Quranic syntax using dependency graphs. It is brain-child of Kais Dukes, a PhD researcher at the School of Computing, University of Leeds. He can be contacted at sckd@leeds.ac.uk.
